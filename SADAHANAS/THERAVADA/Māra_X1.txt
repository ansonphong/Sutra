Māra

Majjhima Nikāya : 26 : Ariyapariyesana Sutta : 42
The Noble Search

( Buddha ) “…By completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This wise one is said to have eclipsed Māra, to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Māra’s eye of it’s opportunity, and to have crossed beyond attachment to the world. One walks confidently, stands confidently, sits confidently, lies down confidently. Why is that? Because one is out of Māra’s range.”


-------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:488

How could a person incline towards sensual pleasures,
Who has seen the source from which [craving and] suffering springs?
Having known acquisition as a tie in the world,
One should train for it's removal.

-------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:461

Māra :
One who has children delights in children,
One with cattle slights in cattle,.
Acquisitions are truly a human's delight;
Without acquisitions one does not delight.

Buddha :
One who has children sorrows over children,
One with cattle sorrows over cattle.
Acquisitions truly are a man's sorrow;
Without acquisitions one does not sorrow.

-------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:476

Māra : 
There is a snare moving in the sky,
Somethings mental which moves about
By means of which I'll catch you yet:
You won't escape me, ascetic!

Buddha :
Forms, sounds, tastes, odours,
And delightful tactile objects --
Desire for these has vanished in me:
You're defeated, End-maker.


-------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:463

Māra :
Long is the life span of human beings,
the good man should not disregard it.
One should live like a milk-sucking baby:
Death has not made its arrival.

Buddha :
Short is the life span of human beings,
The good man should disregard it.
One should live like one with head aflame:
There is no avoiding Death's arrival.


--------------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:456

Though the sky may split open, and the earth quake,
Striking all creatures with terror --
Though one is struck by a dart in their breast --
The enlightened one takes no shelter in acquisitions.


Four Kinds of Acquisitions (Upadhi) :
	The Five Aggregates (khandha / skandha)
	Defilements (kilesa / kleśā)
	Volitional formations (saṅkhāra / saṃskāra)
	Sensual pleasures (kāmacchanda)

**Skandhas**
--------------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:478

Buddha :
[The Five Aggregates / Skandhas]
Form, feeling, perception,
consciousness and sankhara --
'I am not this, this is not mine,'
Thus one is detached from it.

Though they seek one everywhere,
Māra and his army will not find one:
The one thus detached, secure,
Has gone beyond.

[The Five Aggregates / Skhandas]
Form, feeling, perception,
consciousness and sankhara --
This is the poisoned bait of the world
With which the world is infatuated.

When one has transcended this,
The mindful master of dharma
Shines radiantly like the sun,
Having surmounted Māra's realm.

--------------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:451

Those who are well restrained
In body, speech, and mind
Do not come under Māra's spell,
Nor do they become Māra's henchmen.

--------------

Samyutta Nikāya : 4:473

The nights and days do not afflict me,
I see for myself no decline in the world.
Therefore I sleep in peace,
Full of compassion for all beings.

The Hawk // Satipaṭṭhānasaṃyutta, Saṃyutta Nikāya

Therefore, wise ones, do not stray outside of your own resort into the domain of others. Māra will gain access to those who stray outside their own resort into the domain of others; Māra will get a hold on them. And what is not a wise one’s own resort but the domain of others? It is the five cords of sensual pleasure (kāmguṇa). What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. Sounds cognizable by the ear… Odours cognizable by the nose… Tastes cognizable by the tongue… Tactile objects cognizable by the body which are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure (kāmguṇa). This is what is not a wise one’s own resort but the domain of others. Move in your own resort, wise ones, in your own ancestral domain. Māra will not gain access to those who move in their own resort, in their own ancestral domain; Māra will not get a hold on them.

And what is a wise one’s resort, one’s own ancestral domain? It is the four foundations of mindfulness. What four? Here, one dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. One dwells contemplating feelings in feelings… mind in mind… phenomenon in phenomenon, ardent, clearly comprehending,
mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure with regards to the world. This is a wise one’s resort, one’s own ancestral domain.

MN 119 Kāyagatāsati Sutta - Mindfulness of the Body

23. “Bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra finds an opportunity and a support in him. Suppose a man were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clay. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that heavy ball find entry into that mound of wet clay?” ― “Yes, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra finds an opportunity and a support in him.
24. “Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the dry sapless piece of wood with an upper fire-stick?” ― “Yes, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra finds an opportunity and a support in him.
25. “Suppose there were a hollow empty water jug set out on a stand, and a man cam with a supply of water. What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man pour the water into the jug?” ― “Yes, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra finds an opportunity and a support in him.
26. “Bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra cannot find an opportunity or a support in him. Suppose a man were to throw a light ball of string at a door-panel made entirely of heartwood. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that light ball of string find entry through that door-panel made entirely of heartwood?” ― “No, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.
27. “Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood?” ― “No, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.
28. “Suppose, set out on a stand, there were a water jug full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it, and a man came with a supply of water. What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man pour the water into the jug?” ― “No, venerable sir.” ― “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.

MN 106 Āneñjasappāya Sutta - The Way to the Imperturbable

2. “Bhikkhus, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, deceptive; they are illusory, the prattle of fools. Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come ― both alike are Māra’s realm, Māra’s domain, Māra’s bait, Māra’s hunting ground. On account of them, these evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness, ill will, and presumption arise, and they constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training here.

AN:45:40 // Authorities 

What is the Dharma as one's authority?

Here, having gone to the forest, or to an empty room, a wise one reflects thus:

	I did not go forth from my worldly activities for the sake of vanity… but because I am immersed in birth, old age, ad death… Perhaps an end to this entire mass of suffering can be discerned.

	The Dharma is well expounded by the Buddhas, directly visible, immediate, inviting to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise. 

	There are fellow keepers of wisdom who know and see. As one who as gone forth from my worldly activities, it would be improper for me to be lazy and heedless.

	Energy will be aroused in my without slackening; mindfulness ail lbw established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance,; my mind will be concentrated and on-pointed.

Having taken dharma as the authority, one abandons unwholesome and developed the wholesome; one abandons what is blameworthy and developed the blameless; one maintains oneself in pure awareness. This is called Dharma as one's authority.


The devas and Thatāgatas see the fool acting unrighteously in the world.
therefore, one should fare mindfully,
	taking oneself as authority; alert and meditative,
	**taking the world as authority**; and fare in accordance with the Dharma,
	taking dharma as authority.
Truly exerting oneself, a sage does not decline.

Having vanquished Māra, and overcome Yama, the striver has finished with birth.
Such a sage, wise, a world-knower, identifies with mother at all.
