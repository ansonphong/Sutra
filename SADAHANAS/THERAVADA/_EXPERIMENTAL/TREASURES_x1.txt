BUDDHA :
The thirty-two marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns, and the Great Man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other.

If he lives the home life, he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters, all-victorious, who has stabilized his country and possesses the seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure, the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman-treasure, the steward-treasure, and the counselor-treasure as the seventh. His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and heroic, and crush the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the ocean, he rules without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the Dhamma.

But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he becomes an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside the veil in the world.


TRANSLATION : 
The qualities of a virtuous person have been handed down by tradition, and the person who is endowed with virtues has two paths to choose from.

If one lives the home life, one becomes a great deva, a righteous leader who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters, all-victorious, who has stabilized one's world and is endowed with the seven treasures. One has these seven treasures: the truth-treasure, the home-treasure, the travel-treasure, the goods-treasure, the consort-treasure, the helper-treasure, and the teacher-treasure as the seventh. One's many creations are brave and heroic, and crush the ignorance of others; over this earth bounded by the ocean, one rules without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the Dhamma.

But if one goes forth from the home life into homelessness, one becomes an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside the veil in the world.
