EXTENSION TO THE ENEMY
With a mind imbued with compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity, one extends :To my enemy, my prime rival, my arch nemesis, one sworn against me, one who slanders me, one who unfairly disparages me, one who harbours hatred and negetivity towards me, one who wishes death upon me, one who seeks to control me for their own gains, or one through psychic attack or physical blows has has intensionally done harm to me â€”Out of ignorance you have heedlessly cast yourself deeper into the ceaspit of samsara. Like an elephant fallen into quicksand - this will take so long to rise out of. Like a man cutting off his own limbs with the sword of truth - this will take too long to heal. Such an act of mind, speech or body could only arise from the three poisons of hatred, greed, or delusion. Harbouring the three poisons, you could only be suffering already in so much self-harm. How can I return hatred when you have harmed yourself before you have harmed me?My enemy, I forgive you, my nemesis, I forgive you. May your lack of virtue cease, may virtues arise in you where they have not arisen, may those arisen virtues grow. May you swiftly develop wisdom, virtue and rise into the company of noble ones.
